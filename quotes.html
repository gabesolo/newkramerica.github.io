					<li>If you know what happened in the Mets game don't tell me, I taped it. Hello? – Jerry Seinfeld</li>

					<li>It became very clear to me sitting out there today that every decision I've made in my entire life has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat - it's all been wrong. 
						– George Costanza</li>
